Aksara is just a tool to build the ecosystems according to your needs. But
something you built with Aksara should be subjected to it;

You're allowed to re-distribute the ecosystems you built with Aksara without
any concern of my permission, however admitting it was built by you as a whole
is a shame;

Never disappoint the creative people who share their work for free, or you'll
find them selling their future idea at prices you can't reach.
